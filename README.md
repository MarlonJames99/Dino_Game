## Project:
This is a remake of the classic "easter egg" T-Rex game that we can play on Google Chrome when we're out of connection.

### How to play:
Press any key and the dino will start running. Press spacebar to jump over the obstacles in your path.<br>
There's a scorer that keeps increasing with the time and the objective is simply running as long as you can without colliding and getting the higher score you're able to.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.
In addition, I also developed the game to adapt the game size responsively to different screens and devices using a Javascript function.<br>

## Next steps:
> The next step that I have planned to implement in this application are improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be used properly by everyone! <br><br>
> It's missing the favicon image.
